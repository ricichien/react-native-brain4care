## Stack and Libraries

The app utilizes the following mainly libraries:

- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/)
- [JWT](https://jwt.io/)

## Getting Started

To run the Expo app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the GitHub repository for the project.
2. Ensure that you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.
3. Navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal.
4. Run the following command to install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm run dev

# or

yarn dev
```
   
 Once the dependencies are installed, run the Expo development server using the following command: 
 
 
```bash
npm start

#or


   yarn install
  ```
 
This will start the Expo Metro Bundler and provide you with a QR code.

To run the app on a physical device or emulator, you have a few options:

- Use the Expo Go app:
  - Install the Expo Go app on your iOS or Android device.
  - Scan the QR code displayed in the Metro Bundler using the Expo Go app.
  - The app will be bundled and loaded on your device.
- Use an Android emulator:
  - Ensure you have an Android emulator set up on your machine.
  - Start the emulator.
  - Click on "Run on Android device/emulator" in the Metro Bundler.
  - The app will be bundled and loaded on the emulator.
- Use an iOS simulator:
  - Ensure you have Xcode installed on your machine (for macOS users).
  - Click on "Run on iOS simulator" in the Metro Bundler.
  - The app will be bundled and loaded on the iOS simulator.

Expo will compile the app and provide live updates as you make changes to the code.
